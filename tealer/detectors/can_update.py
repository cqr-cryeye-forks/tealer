Algorand supports multiple types of application transactions. All types of application transactions execute the application
and fail if the execution fails. Additional to application execution, each application transaction type will result in different
operations before or after the application execution. This operations will be reverted if the approval program execution fails.

One of the application transaction type is UpdateApplication which

After executing the ApprovalProgram, replace the ApprovalProgram and ClearStateProgram associated with this application ID with the programs specified in this transaction.

Ability to execute UpdateApplication transaction will give complete control of application code, which controls all the assets held by the application.

Attacker sends a UpdateApplication transaction with the new approval program which transfers all the application assets to attacker's address using inner transaction.
