Algorand supports multiple types of application transactions. All types of application transactions execute the application
and fail if the execution fails. Additional to application execution, each application transaction type will result in different
operations before or after the application execution. This operations will be reverted if the approval program execution fails.

One of the application transaction type is DeleteApplication which
```
After executing the ApprovalProgram, delete the application parameters from the account data of the application's creator.

Ability to execute DeleteApplication transaction will give the ability to make application assets permanently inaccesible to anyone.

Attacker sends a DeleteApplication transaction and make assets inaccessible to everyone.
